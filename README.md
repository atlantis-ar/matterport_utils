# matterport_utils
Utilities to prepare data from the [Matterport3D v1 dataset] (https://github.com/niessner/Matterport) for semantic and instance segmentation on panoramic data.

## mpview

A fork of the mpview application, with an additional mode to create the class and instance segmentation maps corresponding to the source views for each of the panoramas.

## preparepano

A script for preparing panoramic data for semantic and instance segmentation, i.e. depth maps, and label maps for classes and instances that are aligned with the provided Matterport skybox images. This results in a set of RGB, depth and label panoramas that can be rendered in a preferred resolution.
